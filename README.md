# Overview
This is my first web3 project. I will build a local ETHEREUM blockchain that the user will be able to 
interact with.


Project will be P2P loan with collateral. 

We will use fake currency.

We will also create fake NFT's to represent things which can be used
as collateral. 



Idea: Borrowers post "CONTRACTS" which loaners can accept. They can give the loan out and receive (in collateral the NFT or wtv)
